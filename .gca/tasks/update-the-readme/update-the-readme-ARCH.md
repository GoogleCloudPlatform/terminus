# Architecture Document: Update README with License Information

## 1. Overview

The goal of this task is to update the project's `README.md` file to clearly state that the project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. This provides clarity to users and contributors about the licensing terms.

## 2. Technical Approach

The technical approach involves editing a single Markdown file, `README.md`, in the root of the repository. No code changes are required.

A new "License" section will be added to the `README.md`. This section will contain a brief statement about the license.

## 3. Component Architecture

The only component affected is the `README.md` file. No other files or parts of the system are impacted.

- **`README.md`**: The main documentation file for the project. It will be modified to include the license information.
